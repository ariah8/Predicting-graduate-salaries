# Predicting-graduate-salaries
As seniors ready to graduate and move on to professional careers in engineering, we have learned that the task of applying and getting a job that not only fits our background but pays accordingly is a difficult one. Along this journey there are multiple obstacles that include reaching out to countless recruiters, submitting applications, and going through enduring interview processes. However, this experience leads to the most important question that recruiters and hiring managers place on our shoulders - what is your desired pay? The mission for this project was to figure out what type of model would accurately predict the expected salary for an incoming engineering graduate based on their academic performance and personality characteristics.
